- never write comments instead make sure code is easy to follow
- never use allow to bypass a lint failure, look for ways to solve the problem either refactoring or following the recommendations of the linter
- use ripgrep (rg) instead of grep for searching
- use fd instead of find for finding files
- when editing settings.json, keep all allow and deny lists sorted alphabetically
- never run multiple Bash commands in parallel, execute them one at a time so each can be reviewed
