;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;      documentation. There you'll find information about all of Doom's
;;      modules and what flags they support.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c g k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;; More information about these modules (and what flags they support) can be
;; found in modules/README.org.
